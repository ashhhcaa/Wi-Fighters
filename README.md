# Wi-Fighters

C# project that takes in input a report with problems from the streets and utilizes a locally hosted LLM to solve the problem and give you a solution for it.

The code has been made by Giulio Ascani, with the help of Matteo Brizzi and Alessandro Massinelli for the setup of the virtual machine, docker and database.
